# Penalty_Based_Lagrangian_Bilevel


- `reformulation_example.ipynb`
  presents 2 simple examples to show how $F(x)$ recovers $f(x,y)|_{y=y^*(x)}$ with mathmatical explanations and readable plots.
- `toy_example.ipynb`
  presents 2 toy examples to show the penalty-based Lagrangian Algorithm can effectively work.
- `SVM_diabetes.ipynb`
  is an experiment that Liuyuan is working on. Liuyuan is trying to reperform the experiments on a SVM hyperparameter optimization problem as discussed both by
  LV-HBA [Yao et al., 2023] and GA [Xu and Zhu, 2023]. The details of their experiments can be seen also at
  https://github.com/SUSTech-Optimization/LV-HBA

  `diabete.txt` is the data file that the SVM experiment is performed on.
