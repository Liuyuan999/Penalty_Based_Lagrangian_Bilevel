# Penalty_Based_Lagrangian_Bilevel

- `hyperparam_opt` folder contains experiments on SVM hyper parameter optimization.
  A SVM hyperparameter optimization problem is well used in testing the performance of BLO algorithms, such as
  LV-HBA [Yao et al., 2023] and GA [Xu and Zhu, 2023]. The details of their experiments can be seen also at
  https://github.com/SUSTech-Optimization/LV-HBA

  - Three algorithms are in py files in `algorithms` folder.
  - Datasets include diabetes dataset and fourclass dataset.
  - Please run the lasted jupter notebook.

- `Transportation` folder contains experiments on some Network planning problems.
- `toy_example.ipynb` presents 2 toy examples to show the penalty-based Lagrangian Algorithm can effectively work.
